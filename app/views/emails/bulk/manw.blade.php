        <h2 align="center">ALiVE 0.9 released! </h2>
        <p>If you didn't know already, we recently released a new version of ALiVE. We highly recommend you update as soon as possible. More information can be found here on the <a href="http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?169350-ALiVE-Advanced-Light-Infantry-Virtual-Environment&p=2802870&viewfull=1#post2802870" target="new">Bohemia Interactive Forum</a> or at our website <a href="http://alivemod.com">http://alivemod.com</a></p>   
        <h3 align="center">Consolidate, Simplify, Stabilise, Enhance</h3>
        <p>Our goal for this sprint was to review the current state of our code!</p>
        <p>We fixed and stabilised where necessary and ensured that ALiVE remains aligned with our aim to provide an intuitive modular mission framework.
        Feedback from users suggested ALiVE wasn’t as easy to use as we would like, so we have made some changes to how the modules are structured.
        We have renamed and combined several, added guidance to the module “Show Info” tabs as well as the in game Field Manual. Full details are on the wiki.</p>
        <h2 align="center"><img src="http://alivemod.com/img/tour2.jpg"></h2>
        <p>Please note, in case you have an issue loading a mission done with a previous version of ALiVE, update the modules in that mission.
        We have left the old modules hidden in the background to give you time to transition over but please update your missions as soon as possible.
        The legacy modules will be removed in an upcoming release!</p>

        <h3>ALiVE War Room</h3>
        <p>The team has been working hard on preparing the Operations Centre! It will enable commanders to track and manage campaigns from the War Room.
        This plans to include near real time tracking of players, live intel feeds and an After Action Review feature as well as web based Command & Control tools
        integrated with those we already have in game. If you’ve not done so already register with us now and start taking advantage of ALiVE mission persistence
        and battlefield data feeds. Please note, that the former @Arma2NET folder for registered servers is now consolidated to @ALiVEServer!
        We recommend updating your server with the shipped folder from the release package or re-downloading it from WarRoom/Server-Setup!
